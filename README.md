# AeroDesign-Project
Designed, analyzed and manufactured RC aircraft of passenger, bush plane and UAV categories as Team Technical Head in DJS Skylark. This was an interdepartmental undergraduate team project where students designed and analyzed different categories of aircraft, and competed in the SAE AeroDesign East competitions held in 2019 and 2020 in Texas and Florida respectively. 

We took part in the Regular and Micro class categories. The Micro class required the designing of an aircraft that would simulate a UAV which is used reqularly in military activities. The designed airaft had to be stored compactly in a box and be able to deploy within a very short timeframe, as is required during military operations. Our primary objective was to maximize the payload fraction, where the payload simulates the missiles carried by the UAVs. Using creative techniques, we were able to achieve the shortest assembly time recorded in the history of the competition, of 10 seconds. 

Here's a good look at our Micro class design for the year 2019 (notice the deployment mechanism from box to plane!):

The Regular Class category required the aircraft design to be able to carry passengers along with heavy payloads. Another iteration in 2020 required the fuselage design to hold very large volume payloads, like cargo aircraft. The objective of the regular class aircraft was to maximize payload carried given wingspan restrictions.  Utilizing creative techniques in payload placement and dynamic and structural stability, we were able to reduce aircraft weight by 60% and secure a high performance ranking in the competition. 

Heres a good look at the Regular Class aircraft we designed in 2019 (notice the tennis balls which denote the passengers being placed in the aircraft wing!):
